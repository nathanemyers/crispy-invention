While hunting around for interesting datasets to practice making `D3.js` charts, I stumbled on the [history](http://bringbackthemile.com/history/progressions) of record breaking mile runs over the past century and some change. As someone who used to run the mile in highschool track, these times really blow me away (I was never able to crack 6 minutes).

One of the more interesting trends to come out of the data is that there appears to be some kind edge gained from running outside. Maybe it's just more aspirational being able to see the sky and feel the wind. Or maybe indoor races are just much less common than outdoor races. Somebody probably knows because they took the time to separate the data out.

The second most interesting thing I learned was that [Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Ethiopia) has a really cool flag.
