## HELLO!

These are my top albums of 2016. I started this late in 2016 and then promptly forgot about it until now: the end of 2017. Enjoy!

This one's got some real bumpers.

![Fishscale](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Fishscale-Ghostface.jpg){:height="150px" :width="150px"}

#### Fishscale - Ghostface Killah
Ghostface kills it all over this. 

*Top Tracks: Shakey Dog, Kilo, The Champ, R.A.G.U., Be Easy, Dogs of War*

####  Big Black Coat - Junior Boys
This one's just got a real groovy opening 3 tracks that can suck you in.

![Hot Soup](https://images.genius.com/fce33b3ebef1d7b319798572d640773e.1000x999x1.jpg){:height="150px" :width="150px"}

####  Hot Soup - Danny Brown
I'll be honest, I didn't really get into Danny Brown till I listened to Hot Soup. Hot Soup made me realize that underneath Danny Brown's signature yelp he also has amazing flow. 

*Top Tracks: Dance, She Love It, Let's Go*

![Atrocity Exhibition](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/AtrocityExhibition.jpg){:height="150px" :width="150px"}

![Live from Trona](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc2aeb335119a49ecbcf/1:1/w_320/23fb0427.jpg){:height="150px" :width="150px"}

#### Live from Trona - Toro y Moi
As someone who has listened to perhaps too much Toro y Moi, this is the one I come back to most frequently. It's just a real chill tour through some of his best stuff, and he did it live in the middle of the desert - which is just a cool trivia touch.

![Do What You Love](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2912073870_16.jpg){:height="150px" :width="150px"}

#### Do What You Love - Ta-Ku
This is just a fun listen. Great intro.

I don't know, this is some cool indie rock shit.

#### Faraway Reach - Classixx
Another Cool Producer! 

*Top Tracks - I don't know, they're all great. One of em has T-Pain laying out all the sweet benefits that come with being a robot.*

#### The Odd Tape - Oddisee
Oddisee made a sweet instrumental hip hop album.

![In Color](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Jamie_xx_-_In_Colour.png){:height="150px" :width="150px"}

![Petestrumentals](https://monolithcocktail.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/tumblr_kvumoh3uve1qzbwkjo1_1280.jpg){:height="150px" :width="150px"}

#### Petestrumentals - Pete Rock
One of the best albums you can put on if you just want to chill and not give a fuck.

![Malibu](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/Anderson-Park-Malibu-Cover-Billboard-650x650.jpg){:height="150px" :width="150px"}

#### Malibu - Anderson .Paak
For me at least, this album is like listening to a bell curve. The beginning and the end are kind of forgettable, but all the tracks in the middle are amazing. 

*Top Tracks: Am I Wrong, Without You, Parking Lot, Come Down*

![Art Angels](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d9/Grimes_-_Art_Angels.png){:height="150px" :width="150px"}

I get this thing stuck in my head all the god dang time.

#### VEGA INTL. NIGHT SCHOOL - Neon Indian
Front to back, this one is one of my all time favorite albums. Period.

![Nonagon Affinity](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1566708845_10.jpg){:height="150px" :width="150px"}

#### Nonagon Affinity - King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard
I have never delivered pizza in my life but I suspect this the perfect pizza delivery album. Key Trivia Fact: The last track of the album flows into the first track.
