## HELLO!

These are my top albums of 2016. I started this late in 2016 and then promptly forgot about it until now: the end of 2017. Enjoy!

- Ratchet - Shamir
This one's got some real bumpers. Top Tracks: Vegas, On The Regular, Demon
- Fishscale - Ghostface Killah
Ghostface kills it all over this. Top Tracks: Shakey Dog, Kilo, The Champ, R.A.G.U., Be Easy, Dogs of War
- 99.9% - Kaytranada
Kaytranada is an amazing producer. Top Tracks: GOT IT GOOD, TOGETHER, GLOWED UP, YOU'RE THE ONE, LITE SPOTS
 - Big Black Coat - Junior Boys
 This one's just got a real groovy opening 3 tracks that can suck you in.
- Hot Soup - Danny Brown
I'll be honest, I didn't really get into Danny Brown till I listened to Hot Soup. Hot Soup made me realize that underneath Danny Brown's signature yelp he also has amazing flow. Top Tracks: Dance, She Love It, Let's Go
- Atrocity Exhibition- Danny Brown
This one's a real gem. Top Tracks: Tell Me What I Don't Know, Rolling Stone, Really Doe, Ain't it Funny, When it Rain
- Live from Trona - Toro y Moi
As someone who has listened to perhaps too much Toro y Moi, this is the one I come back to most frequently. It's just a real chill tour through some of his best stuff, and he did it live in the middle of the desert - which is just a cool trivia touch.
- Do What You Love - Ta-Ku
This is just a fun listen. Great intro.
- Ad Infinitum - Telekinesis
I don't know, this is some cool indie rock shit.
- Freetown Sound - Blood Orange
Dev Hynes is just a cool dude. Top Tracks: Best to You, Desiree
- Faraway Reach - Classixx
Another Cool Producer! Top Tracks - I don't know, they're all great. One of em has T-Pain laying out all the sweet benefits that come with being a robot.
- Good Luck And Do Your Best - Gold Panda
Gold Panda did this whole thing while visiting japan, and it sounds real cool.
- The Odd Tape - Oddisee
Oddisee made a sweet instrumental hip hop album. Top Tracks: On the Table
- In Color - Jamie xx
Lots of bangers intersperced with not bangers. Top Tracks: Gosh, Loud Places, I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)
- Currents - Tame Impala
Just a real great groove. Top Tracks: Let It Happen, Yes I'm Changing, The Less I Know The Better
- Petestrumentals - Pete Rock
One of the best albums you can put on if you just want to chill and not give a fuck.
- Malibu - Anderson .Paak
For me at least, this album is like listening to a bell curve. The beginning and the end are kind of forgettable, but all the tracks in the middle are amazing. Top Tracks: Am I Wrong, Without You, Parking Lot, Come Down
- Art Angels - Grimes
I get this thing stuck in my head all the god dang time. Top Tracks: I don't know, they're all great. Exhibt sometimes SCREAM weirds me out.
- Emotion - Carly Rae Jepsen
Carly brings some A-Game grooves. Top Tracks: Run Away With Me, Emotion, I Really Like You, Gimme Love, All That, Boy Problems, and most importantly: Warm Blood
- VEGA INTL. NIGHT SCHOOL - Neon Indian
Front to back, this one is a classic.
- Nonagon Afinity - King Gizard & the Lizard Wizard
I have never delivered pizza in my life but I suspect this the perfect pizza delivery album. Key Trivia Fact: The last track of the album flows into the first track.
