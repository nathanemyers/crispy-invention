Tooltips are a great way to add more information to a chart, add interactivity and fun. One of the goals of version 4 of [D3.js]() is to break everything up into managable modules. One of the side benefits of this is that it allows easy use of third party modules.  

[D3-tip](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip) is one such module. Together with [D3-voronoi]() you can add easy to use tooltips to your visualizations.
